# Reddit Painpoint Service

A backend-first AI agent that discovers recurring problems and sentiment signals in niche Reddit communities.

- **Input:** Reddit posts & comments (via Reddit API)
- **Process:** Text cleaning, heuristic filtering, sentiment scoring, LLM validation (Gemini)
- **Output:** Curated problem briefs persisted to the database and optionally exported (Email, Notion)

## 1. Why Reddit-only?

Focusing on one platform keeps ingestion, privacy and evaluation requirements simple. Reddit's conversational structure (posts + nested comments) is well-suited to surfacing recurring, real-world problems. Other platforms can be added later by creating a new input client and matching ingress service.


## 2. Problem

Manual discovery of recurring real-world problems across subreddits is slow and noisy. This service automates discovery, validation, and packaging of those findings so teams can act faster.


## 3. Solution

- Periodic collection of posts and comments from configured subreddits
- Sentiment analysis on collected data to validate signal strength
- LLM-based curation (Gemini) to produce structured problem briefs
- Secrets managed dynamically from [Infisical](https://infisical.com) at runtime
- Output: curated briefs persisted to the database and optionally exported (Email / Notion)


## 4. Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+ (tested with 3.13)
- A Reddit app (client ID & secret)
- A Gemini API key (Google LLM)
- An [Infisical](https://infisical.com) project with secrets configured
- Optional: Notion integration + Email credentials

### Install

```powershell
  git clone https://github.com/rocksoncodes/Reddit-Painpoint-Service.git
  cd Reddit-Painpoint-Service
  python -m venv .venv
  .\.venv\Scripts\activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Copy the environment template:

```cmd
copy .env.example .env
```

### Configure `.env`

The `.env` file only needs the Infisical credentials. All other secrets are loaded from Infisical at runtime:

```env
INFISICAL_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
INFISICAL_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
INFISICAL_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
```

### Run

Run the background scheduler (every 2 weeks):

```cmd
python agent.py
```

Run the full pipeline once manually:

```cmd
python main.py
```

```

## 6. Secrets Management

Secrets are loaded dynamically at startup using `InfisicalSecretsService`. When the app initializes, `settings/settings.py` authenticates with Infisical and injects all project secrets into the environment before any constants are resolved.

The following secrets should be configured in your Infisical project:

| Secret | Description |
|---|---|
| `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID` | Reddit app client ID |
| `REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET` | Reddit app client secret |
| `REDDIT_USER_AGENT` | Reddit API user agent string |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Google Gemini API key |
| `NOTION_API_KEY` | Notion integration token *(optional)* |
| `NOTION_DB_ID` | Notion database ID *(optional)* |
| `EMAIL_ADDRESS` | Sender email address |
| `EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` | Email app password |
| `RECIPIENT_ADDRESS` | Report recipient email |
| `DATABASE_URL` | SQLAlchemy database connection URL |


## 7. How it Works

1. **Ingress** — Collect posts + comments from configured subreddits via Reddit OAuth
2. **Sentiment** — Normalize text, filter noise, run VADER sentiment scoring
3. **Curation** — Run structured Gemini prompts to identify and package real, recurring problems
4. **Egress** — Persist validated briefs to the DB and export to configured sinks (Notion / Email)

## 8. Development Status

- Reddit ingestion and data collection
- Sentiment analysis pipeline
- Gemini-based Curator Agent
- Notion sync and email notifications
- Repository pattern (data access layer)
- Dynamic secrets loading via Infisical
- Storage logic consolidated into repositories
- Egress helpers (`chunk_text`, `create_notion_blocks`, `format_email`) extracted to `utils/helpers.py`

## 9. Notes & Limitations

- Backend infrastructure only — no UI
- Focused exclusively on Reddit as a data source
- LLM inference costs apply depending on Gemini usage tier
